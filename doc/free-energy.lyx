\begin_layout Title
A hybrid approach to atomistic simulation of solvation effect: interfacing
 quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics

\begin_layout Abstract
As a widespread phenomenon of fundamental importance in chemistry and technology
, solvation currently is one of the grand challenges in computational chemistry.
 Steady increase in available computational power allows using increasingly
 sophisticated ab initio techniques when studying electronic and atomisitic
 structures of matter.
 Yet not even an explosion in computational power will ever admit a brute
 force atomistic approach at the macroscopic scale.
 For the specific problem of studying solvation we propose a multi-scale
 approach to treat the solute by quantum- and the solvent by statistical
 mechanics.
 The atomistic statistical model delivers insight into the microscopic structure
 of the solvent on the one hand, and relates that to the macroscopic parameters
 of the solvent, such as temperature and pressure, on the other hand – thus
 bridging micro- and macroscopic scales.
 For the statistical model of the solvent, we propose to develop algorithms
 and generic software that permit solving the Born-Green-Yvon hierarchy
 of equations for a molecular solvent, admitting a realistic quantification
 of the corresponding distribution functions.
 While any high-level electronic structure method may be applied as electronic
 structure model, density functional theory is the method of choice for
 complex solutes.
 The interface between these two model partitions will address long-range
 electrostatic electron-solvent interactions while short-range interactions
 will be parameterized by a suitable force field.
 The method is to be implemented as generic module, parallelized for high
 performance applications, like the determination of Gibbs free energy hyper
 surfaces of complex chemical systems.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The environment of an aqueous solution can completely change the products,
 mechanism and rate of a given chemical reaction.
 Therefore, its computational modeling is of central importance for understandin
g many chemical reactions of organic and inorganic species as well as for
 industrial applications 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "book:hirata03"

\end_inset

.
 Timely examples are on-water catalysis, electrocatalysis, “green chemistry”
 (e.g., aqueous phase reforming of biomass-derived feedstock for non-fossile
 fuels), important photocatalytic processes (hydrogen production from water,
 CO2 conversion), and fuel cells.
 Several of these processes are crucial for capturing and using energy form
 renewable sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support current experimental efforts in various areas of catalysis and
 materials science in aqueous media, computational studies are needed to
 examine/predict species and processes at the atomic level.
 The goal of this project is to develop and apply a novel accurate, yet
 efficient computational model for describing solvent effects, including
 the atomistic structure of the solvent.
 This theoretically as well as computationally very challenging problem
 can be tackled only with an interdisciplinary approach: expertise from
 quantum chemistry, computational materials science, and computer science
 is bundled in this collaborative project of TU München (Scientific Computing,
 Catalysis Research Center) and Northwestern University (Chemistry Department),
 Evanston, USA, to provide know-how in high performance computing and theoretica
l chemistry as prerequisites for an accurate and efficient novel software
 tool.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hybrid approach will be implemented that combines a quantum-mechanical
 (QM) description of the solute with a direct statistical microscopic descriptio
n of a molecular solvent.
 The model will be generally applicable, but is first elaborated within
 the existing parallel density functional program ParaGauss for electronic
 structure calculations.
 The structure of the solvent will be quantified by a promising method based
 on the Born--Green--Yvon (BGY) hierarchy of integral equations for solvent
 (pair) distribution densities at finite temperature on a three-dimensional
 (3d) grid.
 Invoking a suitable parameterization, both the classical electrostatic
 effects of a polarizable solvent and the non-classical effects of interacting
 electronic shells will be reproduced.
 The structure of both subsystems, the QM region of the solute and the near-fiel
d distribution of the solvent, will be determined in a mutually consistent
 fashion.
 From such self-consistent treatment, structural properties of the solute,
 essential for modeling reactions in solution in the ground and excited
 states, can be determined.
 Excited state properties are required when charge transfer reactions at
 electrodes or effects of solvation on spectroscopic properties are to be
 examined.
 The demands of the project regarding high-performance computing will be
 tackled by efficient numerical and scalable parallel algorithms.
 The new microscopic model of solvation effects will supersede state-of-the-art
 continuum solvation models and, at the same time, will prove far more cost
 effective than comparable models that rely on molecular dynamics (MD) simulatio
ns with QM forces for averaging over solvent configurations.
 The solvation simulation technique to be realized in this project will
 have a considerable impact on many current topics in materials science
 and chemistry research.
 Based on the expertise of the project partners, the enhanced capabilities
 of the proposed novel computational strategy will be showcased for catalytic
 processes at metal nanoparticles in solution, including photocatalytic
 production of hydrogen from water and electrochemistry, as well as on actinide
 complexation chemistry in solutions of finite ionic strength.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Water is ubiquitous in nature as well as in technical and industrial environment
s.
 Due to its specific physico-chemical properties (as a solvent of polar
 molecules that in solution readily form hydrogen bonds), it plays a crucial
 role as solvent as well as reactant in a huge variety of processes – in
 the environment, in biological systems and in many industrial procedures
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "book:bennaim74,kamerlin11"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, the solvation chemistry of water is a key aspect of environmental
 chemistry, especially with respect to protecting sweet water resources,
 and in remediation and deposition of toxic chemical and radioactive wastes.
 With its goal to explore chemical and physical systems and processes at
 the atomic scale, computational materials science is confronted with two
 important aspects of interaction related to water as solvent.
 Its high dielectric constant, ~80, results in strong screening of long-range
 electrostatic fields.
 On the other hand, due to their strongly polar nature, water molecules
 are oriented when interacting with polarized molecules or solid surfaces,
 act as electron donating or accepting ligands, and easily form oriented
 hydrogen bonds.
 A successfull water model will pick the essential properties of the water
 in a minimal fashion: ab-initio or supermolecule approach is difficult
 to justify where a soft sphere dipolar water-like particles may be sufficient

.
 Current computational strategies either couple a QM treatment of the solute
 with a continuum representation of the bulk solvent or rely on a fully
 atomistic approach in combination with a molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo
 approach for generating suitable configuration averages.
 The latter methods are computationally quite demanding at the accurate
 QM level required when modeling chemical reactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project suggests combining existing computational ingredients using
 a novel method that will overcome several shortcomings of existing procedures.
 First, the new strategy represents the atomistic structure of the solvent
 in an averaged way, thus notably improving on an essential deficiency of
 continuum models.
 Secondly, a costly dynamical treatment of the bulk solvent will be avoided;
 rather, an accurate, yet efficient method is invoked which will permit
 far more realistic models than current dynamic QM methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Continuum solvation models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the most widely used solvation models combine a QM description
 of the electronic structure of a solute molecule with a polarizable continuum
 model (PCM) of the solvent as a dielectric medium 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "tomasi94,tomasi05"

\end_inset

; the solute cavity is shaped via a prescription that relies on the van
 der Waals atomic radii.
 The nuclei and the electrons of the solute region are taken to interact
 electrostatically with the charges induced in the surrounding (polarizable)
 dielectric continuum.
 These charges are represented by a charge density on the surface of the
 cavity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "chipman02"

\end_inset

; generalizations for treating screening effects of ionic solutions have
 been proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mennuci97"

\end_inset

.
 The reduction of the reaction potential to the potential of a charge on
 the cavity surface greatly simplifies the electrostatic problem as there
 are efficient techniques for solving the associated (surface) integral
 equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Phenomenological corrections account for the cavitation energy and dispersion
 interaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 Continuum models reproduce the classical electrostatic interaction of the
 solute with the induced volume charge in a semi-quantitative fashion.
 A particularly intuitive variant of such models, the conductor-like screening
 model (COSMO), 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 was implemented for energies and forces by Rösch's group

\end_inset

 in their code ParaGauss 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "belling98b,ParaGaussV3.1"

\end_inset

.
 However, continuum models provide no insight into the microscopic structure
 of the solvent.
 As mean-field theories they attempt to reproduce the average effect of
 the solute-solvent interactions on the electronic structure of the solute
 by an averaged reaction field of the solvent environment, without offering
 an estimate of the effects of (correlated) thermal fluctuations of the
 microscopic structure on thermodynamic properties of the system.
 Another negative aspect is the empirical choice of the solute cavity size
 and shape.

Explicit solvation models

 contributes to the thermodynamic free energy while the repulsive part determine

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In an associated liquid like water the relatively strong hydrogen bonds
 play a major role for the microscopic structure, even at room temperature.
 Such pronounced solvent-solvent (and similar solute-solvent) interactions
 render the applicability of a continuum solvation model questionable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "book:hirata03"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast, an approach that combines QM calculations with force-field
 based (molecular mechanics, MM) dynamical simulations (molecular dynamics,
 Monte--Carlo), provides detailed insight into the microscopic structure
 of the solvated system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 Here statistical averaging entails significant additional cost, dominated
 by QM calculations.
 Yet, the results of such statistical sampling are only as good as the effective
 force field used to parameterize the solvent-solvent and solute-solvent
 interactions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gordon01"

\end_inset

.
 Important issues regarding the polarizability of solvent molecules have
 to be solved to compete with continuum models in reproducing electrostatic
 interactions.
 The slow convergence of long-range electrostatic interactions with system
 size may still require a polarizable continuum representation of the bulk
 outside of the explicit QM/MM region

\begin_layout Subsection
Reference interaction site model (RISM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Naturally, continuum solvation approaches cannot properly account for the
 structure of the solvent caused by the shape of the solvent molecules and
 their packing, or by hydrogen bonding.
 Explicit discrete models do not directly tackle the important question
 of statistical sampling.
 In contrast, statistical mechanical theories based on distribution functions
 and integral equations achieve a compromise and provide a rigorous framework
 for addressing both issues of solvation models.
 The reference interaction site model (RISM) characterizes a class of integral
 equation theories 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chandler72"

\end_inset

 where the Ornstein--Zernike equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "yoshida00"

\end_inset

 for simple liquids is generalized to mixtures with strong intramolecular
 correlations, due to chemical bonds.
 RISM accounts for a very important aspect of interacting molecules, namely
 their shape, in terms of pairwise site-site interactions between atomic
 centers.
 In its recent form this theory handles electrostatic aspects, although
 to reproduce the dielectric constant of a liquid a phenomenological correction
 of the integral equations may be required 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "perkyns92,book:hirata03"

\end_inset

.
 The theory has been extended from radial correlations only to 3d spatial
 distributions of atomic centers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kovalenko99"

\end_inset

.
 In this 3d form it is suitable for integration with QM models of an arbitrary
 solute, as first demonstrated for Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations and a
 simplified multipole expansion (MPE) of the coupling between the electronic
 Hamiltonian and the solvent distribution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ten-no93"

\end_inset

.
 The MPE technique reduces the electrostatic solute-solvent interaction
 to that of a few multipole moments, in the simplest case atomic charges,
 derived from the electronic density of the QM system, a technique proven
 successful in combination with continuum models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 A more elaborate coupling of the electronic Hamiltonian and the solvent
 environment may include repulsive exchange and charge transfer interactions
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "yoshida00"

\end_inset

.
 The formation of a cavity is an essential byproduct of the RISM method,
 but the burden is shifted from an empirical procedure as in continuum models
 to the (empirical) parameterization of the site-site interactions, mainly
 of the repulsive part of the corresponding force field.

Born--Green--Yvon integro-differential equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently a new approach for approximating solvent densities around a solute
 of arbitrary shape was proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jager07diss,griebel08"

\end_inset

.
 This BGY3dM model invokes the 3d Born--Green--Yvon (BGY) equation for the
 distribution function of a molecular (M) solvent exposed to a field of
 an arbitrary solute, Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:bgy"

\end_inset

.
 The corresponding BGY equation for the solvent-solvent pair distribution
 function employs the Kirkwood approximation as closure relation for three-body
 distribution functions.
 The molecules of the solvent are modeled as rigid bodies.
 Short-range interactions parameterized by pairwise force field parameters
 as well as the long-range Coulomb interaction are taken into account.
 Periodic boundary conditions are enforced for the short-range distribution
 functions.
 Long-range interactions of system replicas in neighboring unit cells may
 optionally be restricted in the case of infinite dilution.
 The resulting integro-differential equations are iteratively solved by
 extensive use of fast Fourier transformations (FFT).
 The overall performance of the method was shown to be promising, yet entailed
 high computational demands for realistic and accurate applications.
 The model was applied to simulate the structure of non-polar (CS
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

) and polar (HCl) solvents with hexane, methanol, and butyric acid as solute
 molecules in addition to simulations with the reference solvent as solute
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In fact, the BGY3dM simulation of a pure solvent is a prerequisite for
 other solute-solvent simulations; the solvent-solvent site-site distribution
 function serve as input to subsequent solute-solvent simulations of an
 arbitrary solute.
 In the BGY3dM approach a solute is treated as source of an external potential
 to which the solvent molecules are exposed.
 Both solvent-solvent and solute-solvent interactions are described by site-site
 pair potentials.

 This coupling of an accurate QM treatment of the solute with the BGY3dM

 Several problems have to be tackled before molecular solvation energies
 and other effects on molecular properties can be determined in QM calculations

 At least the first two of these strategies of increasing accuracy and computati

 and accuracy implications for a mutually consistent reaction field approach.
 For practical applications an efficient and scaling parallelization of
 these approaches will be crucial.
 A related issue is the derivation of the site-site force-field parameterization

The goal of this project is to adapt and interface two independently developed
 methods and the corresponding software packages (one specialized on DFT
 electronic structure methods another for statistical simulations of the
 structure of liquids) aiming at a combined QM description of the solute,
 an accurate microscopic statistical description of a molecular solvent,
 and scalable parallel implementation.
 To reach this goal we will first explore the most efficient way to define
 the interaction functional of the two subsystems.
 The BGY3dM package requires a representation of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

external field
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 induced by the solute, specifically the Coulomb field of the QM electronic
 density, on an equally spaced Cartesian 3d grid.
 For a very high spatial resolution this may become a performance bottleneck
 of the overall task, which has to overcome by an efficient parallelization.
 Conversely, the charge distribution of the solvent represented again on
 a 3d-grid will have to be translated into a contribution to the electronic
 Hamiltonian.
 Implemented in a straightforward way this requires an integration over
 the grid for each matrix element of the (square) Hamiltonian matrix of
 the QM calculation.

\begin_layout Standard
The short-range solute-solvent interaction energy (besides the electrostatic

 The latter will be derived from potentials applied in preceding BGY3dM
 simulations by removing the terms responsible for electrostatic interactions,
 i.e.
 those between point charges in the chosen force field (FF) model.
 The repulsive part of the potential responsible for shape and size of the
 solute cavity will also be treated by this FF contribution and thus is
 crucial for the overall performance.
 The overall quality of the method will be verified for consistency by compariso

 examples of non-polar (CCl

\end_inset

For linear response the work integral is thus a functional of unperturbed
 density distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{0X}(y)$

 and interacting density distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1X}(y)$

 The well established PCM models, for example, address the cavity formation
 work by phenomenological terms based on a simplified cavity shape description.
 In general, a higher order specialized numerical quadrature may be required
 for such processes; the choice of integration path, including the reference

\begin_inset Formula $\int u_{1}(y)\rho_{0X}(y)dy=0$

that makes the negative sign of the leading polarization contribution obvious.
 The sign and the factor

 This intermediate density representation may serve as an abstraction between

 Both of these expressions are convolution integrals with the same isotropic

\begin_layout Standard
The techniques for numeric evaluation of these convolution integrals will
 necessarily depend on the asymptotic properties of the convolution kernel.
 One of the primary difficulties for numeric evaluations is the Coulomb
 tail of the kernel: 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\alpha}(r)\sim-z_{\alpha}/r$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $r\to\infty$
\end_inset

 For this situation it is advantageous to have an analytic expression for
 the Fourier transforms of the long-range asymptotics.
 A sufficiently smooth short range interaction, on the other hand, may be
 efficiently treated by FFT techniques.
 A direct evaluation of a three-dimensional convolution may soon become
 formidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a Coulomb form of the convolution kernel, or any other form that is

\begin_inset Formula $z_{\alpha}$

 to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{\text{S}}(\vec{r})=\int f(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime})n_{\text{v}}(\vec{r}^{\prime})d^{3}r^{\prime},\quad n_{\text{v}}(\vec{r})=\sum_{\alpha}z_{\alpha}\rho_{\alpha}(\vec{r}^{\prime})

Here we introduced the solvent charge density 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{v}}$
\end_inset

 and the Coulomb potential of the electron density 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\text{H}}$
\end_inset

.
 This form helps reducing the number of convolutions to be preformed but
 it is not necessarily critical for the raw performance of the method.
 In practice the most time consuming step happens to be the iterative solution
 of the equations for the solvent site distribution functions

An important aspect of choosing the parametrization

 for the interaction between electrons and solvent sites is the consistency

ns.
 Indeed, the often quoted origin of the repulsive branch in the LJ potential

 When compared to the Coulomb law,

 The ambiguous task of constructing such a parametrization, for instance,
 from an ab-initio data set, may soon prove too tedious and not practical
 for many solute-solvent and solvent-solvent combinations.
 On the other hand an arbitrary complete sampling of an ab-initio potential
 energy surface of a isolated solute-solvent or solvent-solvent pair can

\begin_inset Formula $q$

 All of the following are such functions:

\begin_layout Itemize

 of a pure solvent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A discrete representation of any of these function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)$
\end_inset

 amounts to specifying the grid as a set of points 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}=(r_{k},q_{k})$
\end_inset

 and a set of corresponding values 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y_{k})$
\end_inset

.
 A particular choice is to specify the grids independently for the positions
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and orientations 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 A uniform cartesian grid for vector 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in the simulation cell 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{3}$
\end_inset

 is an obvious choice which has both advantages and drawbacks.
 A short range distribution function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

, may quickly approach a constant at distances 
\begin_inset Formula $|r|\gg a$
\end_inset

 longer that the range parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, thus making the values in the remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{3}-a^{3}$
\end_inset

 volume redundant.
 On the other hand, an equally spaced cartesian grid allows use of fast
 Fourier transformation techniques for solving integral equations for which
 there are efficient implementations available.
 For the equally spaced grid one takes for granted that for any two grid
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

 the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}-r_{1}$
\end_inset

 is also a grid point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following discussion we assume that parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, specifying orientation are the unit quaternions.
 The unit quaternions are often used to parametrize 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

 rotations because of the existing homomorphism between unit quaternion
 group under multiplication and 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

.
 This 2-to-1 correspondence (quaternions that differ by a sign map to the
 same rotation) has a nice property of being a smooth parametrization of
 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

.
 The parameter space for unit quaternions is a three-dimensional surface
 of a sphere, 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

, embedded into the four-dimensional Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{4}$
\end_inset

 with any two opposite poles of the sphere being equivalent.
 Several choices for the (integration) grid on such a manifold exist [Stroud
 1960].
 The equivalence of the opposite poles may be enforced either by considering
 only the functions even in quaternionic parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(r,q)=f(r,-q)$
\end_inset

, or by grid pruning eliminating redundant points.
 For the specialized problem at hand another aspect of the quaternion grid
 may be worth considering.
 Note that for the two species with orientations 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}$
\end_inset

 their relative orientation will be given by quaternion product 
\begin_inset Formula $q=q_{1}^{-1}q_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It may be advantageous if this product is also a grid point if both 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}$
\end_inset

 are themselves grid points (property taken for granted for relative 
\emph on
positions
\emph default
 on uniform cartesian grids).
 Such grids are well defined as they correspond to the exhaustively studied
 point groups as subgroups of 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

.
 We will also consider properties of such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symmetry adapted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 integration grids for solute and solvent molecules exhibiting non-trivial
 symmetry.
 The fact that several orientations of a symmetric molecule are equivalent
 allows one to reduce the domain of the quaternion orientation parameters
 on the three-dimensional sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 to the smaller fundamental domain.
 This fundamental domain of orientation parameters is the counterpart of
 the unit cell in direct- or Brilloin zone in reciprocal space corresponding
 to translational symmetry.

 These numbers are for standard conditions, that is one atmosphere and room

 Since 1 atm is significantly higher than the vapor pressure at phase equilibriu

 is higher that that of liquid water/saturated vapor.
 Indeed the chemical potential of liquid phase/saturated vapor appears to
 be by -8.59 kJ/mol or -2.05 kcal/mol lower according to these numbers.
 This can be seen either from the difference of the tabular values of the
