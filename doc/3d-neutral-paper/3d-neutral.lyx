\begin_layout Abstract
We implemented and applied a hybrid approach for modelling the solvation
 of molecules where we combined a three-dimensional reference interaction
 site model (3D RISM) with quantum mechanical (QM) calculations of the solute.
 The electrostatic potential induced by the solute is derived directly from
 its electron density.
 For neutral solutes, we analyzed the accuracy of calculated solvation free
 energies which are mainly determined by the cavity formation energy.
 As a second contribution, the solute electronic structure relaxation in
 an aqueous medium also has a noticeable influence on the results of SCF-RISM
 calculations.
 By applying a known partial molar volume correction, for which we give
 an alternative interpretation, our hybrid model shows results in good agreement
 with experiment and results calculated with a polarizable continuum model
 (PCM).
 As a model with an atomic solvent representation, RISM accounts for the
 effect of discrete hydrogen bonds which is included only on average in
 PCM models.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solvent environment of a molecule can considerably affect its properties
 and thus also change the products as well as the rate of its chemical reactions
 and even the mechanism of such transformations.
 Therefore, modelling solvation effects is of central importance for understandi
ng many chemical reactions of organic and inorganic species as well as for
 industrial applications

 Examples of pertinent application fields, also of industrial importance,
 are catalytic reactions for the production of hydrogen

\begin_layout Standard
In support of current experimental efforts in various areas of chemistry
 and materials science in aqueous media, computational studies are needed
 to examine or predict species and processes at the atomic level.
 One of the two most popular strategies in computational chemistry for studying
 solution systems is the combination of quantum mechanics (QM) calculations
 with implicit solvation models, e.g., the polarizable continuum model (PCM)
 and its variants, based the conductor-like solvation model (COSMO) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Klamt95,Tomasi05"

\end_inset

.
 Yet, despite the importance of solvation models, these implicit methods
 do not provide insight into the structure and the statistical fluctuations
 of the solvent.
 Another approach to solvation is the so-called explicit solvation model,
 where one treats solute and solvent equivalently by performing molecular
 dynamics (MD) simulation from first principle (ab initio MD – AIMD) or
 MD simulations based on a force-field (molecular mechanics – MM) description
 of both the solute and the solvent medium (MM-MD).
 However, the statistical sampling of large numbers of solvent configurations
 entails significant computational cost.
 Therefore QM dynamic simulations are restricted to models with a comparably
 small numbers of solvent molecules.
 The MM solvent description of MM-MD or hybrid QM/MM methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gao96,Gao92"

\end_inset

 reduce the computational cost.
 Yet, the results of statistical sampling are only as good as the effective
 force field used to parameterize the solvent-solvent and solute-solvent
 interactions.
 Also, to compete with continuum models in reproducing electrostatic interaction
s, one has to account for the polarizability of the solvent medium

Given the difficulties mentioned above, strategies which combine QM methods
 with integral equation theory of molecular liquids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 are regarded as a promising direction to study ions and complexes and their
 chemical reactions in aqueous solution with sufficient accuracy and at
 affordable cost.
 One successful approach of this type is the reference interaction site
 model (RISM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chandler72"

\end_inset

 which provides solvation (free) energies and also averaged solvent structures
 via site-site radial distribution functions (RDF).
 The hybrid approach of RISM together with a self-consistent field (SCF)
 QM solute description was first proposed at the level of Hartree-Fock theory
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Later-on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) was combined with
 3D RISM to investigate the electronic structure of a metal–water interface

 Thus far, several implementations

 combine RISM theory with a state-of-the-art QM method to provide an alternative
 approach for classical implicit and explicit solvation models.
 The applications of the hybrid RISM-SCF method has successfully ben applied
 to calculate acidity and basicity, the chemical equilibrium and the molecular
 structure as well as chemical reactions and excited states in solution

Mainly two factors determine the solvent effect in the SCF-RISM method,
 the contributions of the solute electronic relaxation and the excess chemical
 potential 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "book:Hirata03"

\end_inset

.
 The excess chemical potential, which measures the free energy change of
 coupling a solute molecule to the solvent, serves as the approximation
 of the solvation free energy in MM-RISM methods.
 The excess chemical potential calculated from 3D RISM is well known 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to overestimate the energy required for the formation of the solute cavity.
 Thus 3D RISM poorly predicts the thermodynamics of hydrophobic hydration
 of neutral solutes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kovalenko00a"

\end_inset

.
 To overcome this weakness, several correction methods of the solvation
 free energy have been proposed, including the repulsive bridge correction
 (RBC) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "book:Hirata03,Kovalenko00a"

, the cavity formation energy correction

 These correction methods are mainly applied in MM-RISM calculations, in
 which the solute electronic structure is assumed not to be relaxed.
 Yet, as in the PCM method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Orozco07"

\end_inset

, the energy due to the electronic relaxation of the solute is not negligible
 in the SCF-RISM method.
 The change of the solvation free energy due to solute polarization is almost
 proportional to this term

 but the influence of solute polarization on the accuracy of the solvation
 free energy has not been well studied in SCF-RISM calculations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we examine in the following the accuracy of the solvation free
 energy in hybrid QM RISM calculations for a test set of 43 neutral organic
 solute molecules in aqueous solution.
 The test solutes include hydrocarbon chains and aromatic rings, and various
 organic molecules with functional groups.
 A list of all species is given in the Supporting Information (SI).
 We explore the effect of solute electronic relaxation in stepwise fashion.
 Starting from MM-RISM as a reference, we introduce the polarization of
 the solute in the solvent medium, first by applying first-order perturbation
 theory (PT1-RISM), going on to a second-order perturbation theory treatment
 (PT2-RISM), and finally moving on to the full SCF-RISM relaxation.
 For all method variants, we compare the performance of the recently reported
 PMV correction term 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to the solvation free energy.
 To analyze the accuracy the RISM approach, we discuss these results in
 comparison to those of PCM calculations and to experiment.

Interaction between QM solute and RISM solvent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the 3D RISM MM theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the solute interaction potential acting on solvent site 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is derived from the site-specific contribution of a solvent-solute interaction
 defined as the sum of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulomb terms.
 The LJ energy term, 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{\text{LJ}}=4\sum_{i\alpha}\epsilon_{i\alpha}\left[(\sigma_{i\alpha}/r_{i\alpha})^{12}-(\sigma_{i\alpha}/r_{i\alpha})^{6}\right]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i\alpha}=|\vec{r}_{i}-\vec{r}_{\alpha}|$
\end_inset

, accounts for short-range repulsion and dispersion interactions and is
 the sum of pairwise site-site contributions between solute and solvent
 site 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, respectively, as in the MM case.
 The electrostatic interaction between the charge density of the QM solute
 and the charged solvent sites reads:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U^{\text{C}}=\int n_{\text{v}}(\vec{r})f_{\text{C}}(|\vec{r}-\vec{r}'|)n_{\text{u}}(\vec{r}')d^{3}rd^{3}r'.\label{eq:solute-solvent-interaction}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{v}}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{u}}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

 are the solvent and the solute charge densities, respectively, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\text{C}}(r)=1/r$
\end_inset

 is the Coulomb kernel.
 In self-consistent calculations this expression for the electrostatic interacti
ons is used to define two types of potentials, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{u}}=f_{\text{C}}\ast n_{\text{u}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{v}}=f_{\text{C}}\ast n_{\text{v}}$
\end_inset

, acting on charged solvent sites and the solute charges (electrons and
 nucleus), respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy for evaluating these two potentials differs slightly due to
 the nature of the charged densities 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{u}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{v}}$
\end_inset

.
 The solvent charge density, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{v}}=\rho\sum_{\alpha}q_{\alpha}g_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, appearing in the expression for the solvent electrostatic potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{v}}$
\end_inset

, represents statistical average that is represented on a uniform Cartesian
 grid.
 For a neutral solute, the integral of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{v}}$
\end_inset

 is zero.
 The corresponding potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{v }}$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by solving the Poisson equation with periodic boundary
 conditions, using fast Fourier transform techniques.
 For neutral solutes with typical dipole moments and a sufficiently large
 unit cell this may be justified

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 Correspondingly, RISM calculations of the excess chemical potential with

 By construction, the solvent reaction field,

 According to this regression, the coefficient of determination from the

 After applying the PMV correction, the linear correlation between the remaining

 This reduction indicates displacing the asymptotic cavity formation error

 distributed over the simulation cell.
 In this section the charge density of a solute is determined from a gas-phase
 QM calculation.
 The corresponding solvent distribution functions are solutions of 3D RISM
 equations with the electrostatic field of such unperturbed gas-phase solute
 replacing the field of point charges in the definition of

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A series of approximations and a self-consistent hybrid approach combining
 QM solute description with 3D RISM for solvent medium reveals that for
 neutral solutes, the accuracy of calculated solvation free energies is
 mainly determined by the asymptotic error of cavity formation energies.
 Significantly better agreement with experimental results could be obtained
 by applying partial molar volume correction as also reported in previous
 non-hybrid studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Palmer10,Sergiievskyi14,Misin15"

\end_inset

.
 The undeniably useful partial molar volume correction has been previously
 justified empirically 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and by thermodynamic arguments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 which were later disputed, however 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Song15"

\end_inset

; also a recent work advocates a different choice of the prefactor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Misin15"

\end_inset

.
 We presented an asymptotic analysis that offers an alternative interpretation
 of the error origin and leads, in case of simple liquids, to the same prefactor
 as in Ref.

In a comparison of approximate methods we found that two representations
 of the solute charge density, by point charges of a force-field and by
 gas-phase QM density, lead to quite comparable solvation energies with
 mean absolute deviation of about 1

\begin_inset space ~

 We investigated an approximate way to estimate electron relaxation in response
 to solvent reaction field and a magnitude of the corresponding solvent
 relaxation energy.
 It appears that an approximate and self-consistent approaches agree on
 average to better than 0.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol.
 Although the ratio of two relaxation terms, solute polarization and solvent
 relaxation energies, is nearly constant for all solutes the value of this
 ratio differs notably from the intuitive linear electrostatic response
 limit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relaxation terms are supposed to be important for neutral molecules
 with overall very moderate solvation energies; the observed scale of the
 relaxation terms seems to support that.
 In spite, we find that the approximate method to address relaxation terms
 only slightly improves comparison to experiment, while a self-consistent
 approach hardly improves it.
 One of the possible reason might be an artifact of electron cloud polarization
 by localized positive volume charge of the solvent medium which is likely
 to be overestimated in the absence of repulsive exchange interactions of
 solute- and solvent electrons.
 We demonstrated a slight overestimation of induced solute dipoles in comparison
 to PCM which may be an indication of such an artifact.
 Meanwhile, increase of water hydrogen and oxygen distribution from unperturbed
 to self-consistently relaxed solute in solvent field also supports our
 surmise.

Another important factor, the change of the solute electrostatic property,
 which is perturbed by the solvent medium, is also found to have noticeable
 contribution to the solvation free energy calculation.
 Meanwhile, from the RDF in SCF-RISM, we found that the rearrangement of
 the solute charge density calculation causes the strengthening of the hydrogen
 bond between solute and water solvent.

AM: there was not a single word about it in the text.
 Is there any number that could be quoted in support of this claim (to convince
 me, when not for the reader's eyes)?

Another possibility is that an asymptotic correction limited to a term strictly
 proportional to the solute volume is insufficient to reduce the intrinsic
 error of 3D RISM to better than 1--2

kcal/mol for these solute/solvent combinations.
 It is likely that a careful analysis of the 3D RISM asymptotic behavior
 may offer a more accurate error estimate and resolve some of the controversies.

For simplicity assume a model is characterized by a single degree of freedom

 Minimization of an energy expression 
\begin_inset Formula

 Response to an electric field addition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta e=-fd$

\begin_inset Formula $d-d_{0}=a^{-1}f$

A simple expression for the solvation energy of a rigid dipole 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu[d]=-b(d-d_{\ast})^{2}/2
\]

\end_inset

is sufficiently flexible to parametrize the electric cavity reaction field
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\ast}[d]=-\partial\mu/\partial d$
\end_inset

 to have the linear form with some, in general, non-zero intercept 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\ast}[0]=-bd_{\ast}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu[d_{0}]=-\frac{b}{2}(d_{0}-d_{\ast})^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 solvation energy.

However, by minimizing the sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G[d]=e[d]+\mu[d]
\]

\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 we find a new minimum (given that 
\begin_inset Formula $0<b<a$
\end_inset

) at 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{1}=\frac{ad_{0}-bd_{\ast}}{a-b}.
\]

\end_inset

 The values of the energy expression and solvation energy are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e[d_{1}]=\frac{a}{2}\left[\frac{b}{a-b}\right]^{2}(d_{0}-d_{\ast})^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu[d_{1}]=-\frac{b}{2}\left[\frac{a}{a-b}\right]^{2}(d_{0}-d_{\ast})^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

 The total is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G[d_{1}]=-\frac{ab}{2(a-b)}(d_{0}-d_{\ast})^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

The ratio of the changes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\mu[d_{1}]-\mu[d_{0}]}{e[d_{1}]-e[d_{0}]}=-\left[2-\frac{b}{a}\right]
\]

\end_inset

is a negative number between 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $0<b<a$
\end_inset

 and is independent of system parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\ast}$
\end_inset

.
 Naturally only the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 defining the scale of two contributions matters for this result.
 The relaxation effect of the free energy is 
\begin_inset Formula $o(b^{2})$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G[d_{1}]-G[d_{0}]=-\frac{b^{2}}{2(a-b)}(d_{0}-d_{\ast})^{2}
\]

\end_inset

to be compared to the 
\begin_inset Formula $o(b)$
\end_inset

 scale of 
\begin_inset Formula $G[d_{0}]$
\end_inset

.
 The limit 
\begin_inset Formula $b\to0$
\end_inset

 should be performed carefully, for instance, by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\ast}=-f_{\ast}/\epsilon$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\to0$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $bd_{\ast}=-f_{\ast}=\text{const}$
\end_inset

 and discarding the divergent but 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-independent term off 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu[d]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G[d]$
\end_inset

.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G[d_{1}]-G[d_{0}]\to\frac{f_{\ast}^{2}}{2a}
\]

\end_inset

 and the ratio of the two contributions to this relaxation energy is exactly
 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

.
