\begin_layout Abstract
We implement and applied a hybrid approach combining the three-dimensional
 reference interaction site model (3D RISM) with quantum mechanics (QM)
 calculation, in which the electrostatic potential induced by the solute
 is directly derived from its electron density.
 The accuracy of the calculation of solvation free energy for neutral solutes
 is analyzed, of which the mainly determining factor is confirmed as the
 solute cavity formation effect.
 Another contribution from the solute electronic structure relaxation in
 aqueous medium, which is possibly induced by the hydrogen bond between
 solute and water solvent, also has noticeable influence on the results
 of SCF-RISM calculation.
 By applying the partial molar volume correction, our hybrid model shows
 results in good agreement with experiment and a polarizable continuum model,
 while in the latter the hydrogen bond effect is missing.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The environment of an aqueous solution can completely change the products,
 mechanism and rate of a given chemical reaction.
 Therefore, its modelling is of central importance of understanding many
 chemical reactions of organic and inorganic species as well as for industrial
 applications.
 Example of pertinent application fields are catalytic reactions like hydrogen
 production, CO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$

 conversion, biomass conversion, or solution chemistry of actinides, which
 is important for radioactive waste disposal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support current experimental efforts in various areas of catalysis and
 materials science in aqueous media, computational studies are needed to
 examine/predict species and processes at the atomic level.
 One of the two most popular strategies in computational chemistry to study
 solution systems is the combination of quantum mechanics (QM) calculations
 with implicit solvation models, for example, polarizable continuum model
 (PCM) and its variant based the conductor-like solvation model (COSMO).
 Although implicit solvation models have been applied to various chemical
 processes in solution, they provide no insight into the structure and statistic
al fluctuations of the solvent.
 Another type of model is the so-called explicit solvation model, which
 includes the hybrid method between QM calculation and molecular mechanics
 (MM) description of the solvent medium (QM/MM method), and the more accurate
 approach by directly performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation from
 first principle (ab initio MD, shorthanded as AIMD).
 However, the results of statistical sampling in QM/MM method are only as
 good as the effective force field used to parameterize the solvent-solvent
 and solute-solvent interactions, and the polarizability of the solvent
 medium has to be taken into account to compete with continuum models in
 reproducing electrostatic interactions.
 Also, the statistical sampling of large numbers of solvent configurations
 entails significant computational cost to the combination of QM and MM
 calculations.
 For that same reason, more accurate QM dynamic simulations are restricted
 to a comparably small number of solvent molecules due to their very high
 computational demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the difficulties mentioned above, strategies which combine QM methods
 with integral equation theory of molecular liquids are regarded as a promising
 direction to study ions and complexes and their chemical reactions in aqueous
 solution with sufficient accuracy and at affordable cost.
 One successful approach of this type is the reference interaction site
 model (RISM) which provides solvation energies and also averaged solvent
 structures via site-site radial distribution functions (RDF).
 The hybrid approach of RISM with self-consistent field (SCF) QM calculation
 was first proposed by Ten-no, Hirata and Kato on the basis of a variational
 method to Hartree-Fock equation

.
 To take into account the solvent structure information presented in three
 dimensional (3D) space around the solute molecule, Kovalenko and Hirata
 combined the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with 3D RISM
 to investigate the electronic structure for a metal--water interface 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Until now, many implementations

key "Sato00,Du03,Gusarov06,Casanova07,Kloss08,Yoshida11,Yoshida14"

\end_inset

 have been made to combine RISM theory with state-of-the-art QM method to
 provide researchers an alternative approach for classical implicit and
 explicit solvation models to study chemical reactions and processes in
 solutions.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the numerous implementations, the keys determining the energetic
 accuracy of the hybrid methods of RISM with QM calculation are not thoroughly
 discussed.
 On one hand, it is well known that the solvation free energy calculated
 from 3D RISM overestimates the energy of forming cavity for solute, which
 is problematic especially for neutral ones, since their solvation free
 energy values are around several kcal/mol.
 The possible correction strategies include the repulsive bridge correction

 term, cavity formation energy correction

\end_inset

 term and polar molar volume (PMV) correction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 term.
 On the other hand, in SCF RISM-QM calculations, the energy of solute electronic
 structure relaxation upon the solvation of the solute from gas phase to
 aqueous phase must be considered, since it is reported that the change
 in the solvation energy due to the polarization is nearly proportional
 to this term

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\Delta\mu\sim-2E_{reorg}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 Therefore, it will be also interesting to clarify the influence of electronic
 relaxation of the solute, before applying QM-RISM hybrid method energetically
 describing chemical reactions in solution.

 In order to investigate the energetic accuracy, we applied the most recently
 reported PMV correction term with 3D RISM while the free energy functional
 of solutes are determined with four different representation of the solvated
 system: (1) The solutes are represented by the atomic partial charges assigned
 on each solute site, which are also tabulated in standard force field database
 as the Lennard--Jones (LJ) parameters in a MM manner (MM-RISM); (2) The
 free energy functional is perturbed by the first order perturbation theory
 manner (PT1-RISM); (3) The free energy functional is perturbed by the second
 order perturbation theory manner (PT2-RISM); (4) The free energy functional
 is determined self consistently with the relaxation of QM and RISM theory.

 thus here we shortly go through the fundamental formulas in the theory.
 The solute-solvent 3D RISM integral equation has the following convolution
 form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h^{uv}=c^{uv}\ast\chi^{v}.\label{eq:rism-uv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{uv}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{uv}$
\end_inset

 are (rectangular) matrices of the 3D total correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha}^{uv}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

 and 3D direct correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\alpha}^{uv}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

, both unknowns of the equation.
 The superscripts 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 label the solute and the solvent, respectively.
 The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 enumerate the solvent site interacting with the whole solute.
 In Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the solvent is represented by its (square symmetric) susceptibility matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{v}=\omega^{v}+\rho h^{vv}$
\end_inset

 and could be obtained self-consistently from the pure solvent 1D RISM equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "book:Hirata03,Kovalenko99b"

\end_inset

.
 In practice one operates with the dimensionless Fourier transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\chi}^{v}(k)$
\end_inset

 of the solvent susceptibility.
 The low 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\chi}_{\alpha\gamma}^{v}(0)=\rho\kappa/\beta$
\end_inset

 encodes the solvent compressibility 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 and the next leading 
\begin_inset Formula $o(k^{2})$
\end_inset

 terms corrected by DRISM control the dielectric response of the solvent
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 As usual 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1/T$
\end_inset

 is the inverse of the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

\begin_layout Standard

 In this paper, the Kovalenko and Hirata (KH)

 closure is used, which reads 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha}=f(-\beta u_{\alpha}+h_{\alpha}-c_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

) with 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\exp(x)-1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\le0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=x$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\alpha}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

 is the interaction potential between solvent site 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and the solute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the excess chemical potential of solvation could be analytically
 derived from distribution functions.
 For HNC closure, it has the following form 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu=\frac{\rho}{\beta}\int\sum_{\alpha=1}^{N_{\text{v}}}\left[|h_{\alpha}|^{2}/2-c_{\alpha}-c_{\alpha}h_{\alpha}/2\right]d^{3}r\label{eq:mu}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and in the corresponding expression for the KH closure the 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{2}$
\end_inset

-terms contribute only in the depletion regions where 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha}<0$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This expression, together with a linear convolution relation, Eq.

\end_inset

, between the total and direct correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 leads to seriously overestimated cavity formation energies.
 Indeed, by assuming a simple liquid exposed to a potential sufficiently
 repulsive within an extended volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and approximating 
\begin_inset Formula $h\approx-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c\approx-z^{-1}$
\end_inset

 within the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

, by way of the convolution relation and using a short hand notation 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\rho\kappa/\beta$
\end_inset

 for the compressibility factor, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta\mu\approx\rho V_{0}(z^{-1}+1)/2.\label{eq:mu-asymptotic-rism}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Water is nearly incompressible --- the corresponding compressibility factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx1/16$
\end_inset

 at normal conditions; RISM theories predict comparable numbers depending
 on the closure and water model.

 for the particular water density at normal conditions even in the regions
 with vanishingly small densities.
 It may be instructive to note that by using the ideal gas equation of state,

 The solvent charge density, when it appears in an expression for solvent

 a uniform Cartesian grid.
 The corresponding potential is obtained by solving Poisson equation with
 periodic boundary conditions using fast Fourier transform.
 For neutral solutes with typical dipole moments and large periodic cells
 this may be justified

 Hence, RISM calculations of the excess chemical potential with the discrete

 give two lowest approximations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu[\bar{n}_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$

 We explain the reference to the first order perturbation theory (PT1) by
 declaring the excess chemical potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu[n_{\text{u}}]$

The difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E_{\text{SCF}}=E[n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}]-E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$

 in the last equation is the energy corresponding to the solute polarization

 By construction, the solvent reaction field, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mu/\delta n_{\text{u}}=\phi_{\text{u}}$

 In this section the charge density of a solute is determined from a gas-phase

 The self-consistent approach produces solute polarization energies

 A possible reason is an overestimation of the solute polarization by volume
 charge of solvent medium due to neglect of the repulsive exchange interaction

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A series of approximations and a self-consistent hybrid approach combining
 QM solute description with 3D RISM for solvent medium reveals that for
 neutral solutes, the accuracy of calculated solvation free energies is
 mainly determined by the asymptotic error of cavity formation energies.
 Significantly better agreement with experimental results could be obtained
 by applying partial molar volume correction as also reported in previous
 non-hybrid studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Palmer10,Sergiievskyi14,Misin15"

\end_inset

.
 The undeniably useful partial molar volume correction has been previously
 justified empirically 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Palmer10"

\end_inset

 and by thermodynamic arguments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sergiievskyi14"

\end_inset

 which were later disputed, however 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Song15"

\end_inset

; also a recent work advocates a different choice of the prefactor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Misin15"

\end_inset

.
 We presented an asymptotic analysis that offers an alternative interpretation
 of the error origin and leads, in case of simple liquids, to the same prefactor
 as in Ref.

In a comparison of approximate methods we found that two representations
 of the solute charge density, by point charges of a force-field and by
 gas-phase QM density, lead to quite comparable solvation energies with
 mean absolute deviation of about 1

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

 We investigated an approximate way to estimate electron relaxation in response
 to solvent reaction field and a magnitude of the corresponding solvent
 relaxation energy.
 It appears that an approximate and self-consistent approaches agree on
 average to better than 0.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol.
 Although the ratio of two relaxation terms, solute polarization and solvent
 relaxation energies, is nearly constant for all solutes the value of this
 ratio differs notably from the intuitive linear electrostatic response
 limit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relaxation terms are supposed to be important for neutral molecules
 with overall very moderate solvation energies; the observed scale of the
 relaxation terms seems to support that.
 In spite, we find that the approximate method to address relaxation terms
 only slightly improves comparison to experiment, while a self-consistent
 approach hardly improves it.
 One of the possible reason might be an artifact of electron cloud polarization
 by localized positive volume charge of the solvent medium which is likely
 to be overestimated in the absence of repulsive exchange interactions of
 solute- and solvent electrons.
 We demonstrated a slight overestimation of induced solute dipoles in comparison
 to PCM which may be an indication of such an artifact.

Another important factor, the change of the solute electrostatic property,
 which is perturbed by the solvent medium, is also found to have noticeable
 contribution to the solvation free energy calculation.
 Meanwhile, from the RDF in SCF-RISM, we found that the rearrangement of
 the solute charge density calculation causes the strengthening of the hydrogen
 bond between solute and water solvent.
