\begin_layout Abstract
We implement and apply the combination of three-dimensional reference interactio
n site model (3D RISM) with quantum mechanics (QM) calculation, in which
 the electrostatic potential induced by the solute is directly derived from
 its electron density.
 The accuracy of the calculation of solvation free energy for neutral solutes
 is analyzed, of which the mainly determining factor is confirmed as the
 solute cavity formation effect.
 Another contribution from the solute electronic structure relaxation in
 aqueous medium, which is possibly induced by the hydrogen bond between
 solute and water solvent, also has noticeable influence on the results
 of SCF-RISM calculation.
 By applying the partial molar volume correction, our hybrid model shows
 results in good agreement with experiment and a polarizable continuum model,
 while in the latter the hydrogen bond effect is missing.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The environment of an aqueous solution can completely change the products,
 mechanism and rate of a given chemical reaction.
 Therefore, its modelling is of central importance of understanding many
 chemical reactions of organic and inorganic species as well as for industrial
 applications.
 Example of pertinent application fields are catalytic reactions like hydrogen
 production, CO

 conversion, biomass conversion, or solution chemistry of actinides, which
 is important for radioactive waste disposal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support current experimental efforts in various areas of catalysis and
 materials science in aqueous media, computational studies are needed to
 examine/predict species and processes at the atomic level.
 One of the two most popular strategies in computational chemistry to study
 solution systems is the combination of quantum mechanics (QM) calculations
 with implicit solvation models, for example, polarizable continuum model
 (PCM) and its variant based the conductor-like solvation model (COSMO).
 Although implicit solvation models have been applied to various chemical
 processes in solution, they provide no insight into the structure and statistic
al fluctuations of the solvent.
 Another type of model is the so-called explicit solvation model, which
 includes the hybrid method between QM calculation and molecular mechanics
 (MM) description of the solvent medium (QM/MM method), and the more accurate
 approach by directly performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation from
 first principle (ab initio MD, shorthanded as AIMD).
 However, the results of statistical sampling in QM/MM method are only as
 good as the effective force field used to parameterize the solvent-solvent
 and solute-solvent interactions, and the polarizability of the solvent
 medium has to be taken into account to compete with continuum models in
 reproducing electrostatic interactions.
 Also, the statistical sampling of large numbers of solvent configurations
 entails significant computational cost to the combination of QM and MM
 calculations.
 For that same reason, more accurate QM dynamic simulations are restricted
 to a comparably small number of solvent molecules due to their very high
 computational demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the difficulties mentioned above, strategies which combine QM methods
 with integral equation theory of molecular liquids are regarded as a promising
 direction to study ions and complexes and their chemical reactions in aqueous
 solution with sufficient accuracy and at affordable cost.
 One successful approach of this type is the reference interaction site
 model (RISM) which provides solvation energies and also averaged solvent
 structures via site-site radial distribution functions (RDF).
 The hybrid approach of one dimensional (1D) RISM with self-consistent field
 (SCF) QM calculation was first proposed by Ten-no, Hirata and Kato on the
 basis of a variational method to Hartree-Fock equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Tenno93"

\end_inset

.
 However, RDFs in 1D-RISM are radial symmetric and dependent only on the
 distance between interaction sites.
 To take into account the solvent structure information presented in three
 dimensional (3D) space around the solute molecule, Kovalenko and Hirata
 combined the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with 3D RISM
 to investigate the electronic structure for a metal--water interface 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kovalenko99a"

\end_inset

.
 Until now, many implementations have been made to combine RISM theory with
 state-of-the-art QM method to provide researchers an alternative approach
 for classical implicit and explicit solvation models to study chemical
 reactions and processes in solutions.

 To investigate the solvent effects on the electronic structure of solvated

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the numerous implementations, most current hybrid methods of RISM
 with QM calculation construct the electrostatic potential (ESP) induced
 by QM solute with atomic charge fitted from solute electron density.
 However, it is not sufficient to describe the ESP generated by fitted charge
 only

, and more problems would emerge from the existence of a buried atom in
 the system, without saying that the choice for the grid set for fitting
 process has influence on the accuracy

 To obtain more realistic Coulomb interactions, Yokogawa et al.

 proposed the second generation of RISM-SCF theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, in which the spatial electron density distribution (SEDD) of QM solute
 is included in the RISM-SCF calculation (RISM-SCF-SEDD), by utilizing the
 auxiliary basis set (ABSs) at each atom following the procedure of Gill

 At the same time, Minezawa et al.

 also reported their 3D RISM SCF implementation in which the ESP map on
 a 3D grid is constructed directly from the electron density.
 In this article, we proposed a new method to derive ESP directly from the
 real-space electron density of KS-DFT orbitals, and combine it with the
 parallel code ParaGauss

.
 By utilizing the soft-core pseudopotentials, our hybrid method provides
 an alternative approach for accurate and robust implementation for 3D RISM
 SCF implementation, which could be extended to other QM code by coupling
 the real-space representation of solute with 3D RISM solvent medium via
 an convenient interface.

\begin_layout Standard
It is well known that the solvation free energy calculated from 3D RISM
 overestimates the energy of forming cavity for solute, which is problematic
 especially for neutral ones, since their solvation free energy values are
 around several kcal/mol.

 term.
 In this paper, we applied the most recently reported PMV correction term
 with 3D RISM while the ESP of solutes are represented with four different
 strategies: (1) The ESP of solutes are derived from the atomic partial
 charges assigned on each solute site, which are also tabulated in standard
 force field database as the Lennard--Jones (LJ) parameters in a MM manner
 (MM-RISM); (2) By replacing the atomic charge as frozen electron density
 which is determined from gas-phase QM calculation, solving the solvent
 correlation functions from 3D RISM equation (PT1-RISM); (3) QM solute is
 perturbed by the solvent reaction field (PT2-RISM); (4) The combination
 of (2) and (3), in which the solvent correlation functions and solute electroni
c structures are determined in the self consistent fashion (SCF-RISM).

 thus here we shortly go through the fundamental formulas in the theory.
 The solute-solvent 3D RISM integral equation has the following convolution
 form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h^{uv}=c^{uv}\ast\chi^{v}.\label{eq:rism-uv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{uv}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{uv}$
\end_inset

 are (rectangular) matrices of the 3D total correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha}^{uv}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

 and 3D direct correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\alpha}^{uv}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

, both unknowns of the equation.
 The superscripts 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 label the solute and the solvent, respectively.
 The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 enumerate the solvent site interacting with the whole solute.
 In Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the solvent is represented by its (square symmetric) susceptibility matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{v}=\omega^{v}+\rho h^{vv}$
\end_inset

 and could be obtained self-consistently from the pure solvent 1D RISM equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "book:Hirata03,Kovalenko99b"

\end_inset

.
 In practice one operates with the dimensionless Fourier transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\chi}^{v}(k)$
\end_inset

 of the solvent susceptibility.
 The low 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\chi}_{\alpha\gamma}^{v}(0)=\rho\kappa/\beta$
\end_inset

 encodes the solvent compressibility 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 and the next leading 
\begin_inset Formula $o(k^{2})$
\end_inset

 terms corrected by DRISM control the dielectric response of the solvent
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 As usual 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1/T$
\end_inset

 is the inverse of the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

\begin_layout Standard

 solvable.
 In this paper, the Kovalenko and Hirata (KH) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 closure is used, which reads 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha}=f(-\beta u_{\alpha}+h_{\alpha}-c_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

) with 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\exp(x)-1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\le0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=x$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\alpha}(\vec{r})$
\end_inset

 is the interaction potential between solvent site 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and the solute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the excess chemical potential of solvation could be analytically
 derived from distribution functions.
 For HNC closure, it has the following form 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu=\frac{\rho}{\beta}\int\sum_{\alpha=1}^{N_{\text{v}}}\left[|h_{\alpha}|^{2}/2-c_{\alpha}-c_{\alpha}h_{\alpha}/2\right]d^{3}r\label{eq:mu}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and in the corresponding expression for the KH closure the 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{2}$
\end_inset

-terms contribute only in the depletion regions where 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha}<0$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This expression, together with a linear convolution relation, Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, between the total and direct correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 leads to seriously overestimated cavity formation energies.
 Indeed, by assuming a simple liquid exposed to a potential sufficiently
 repulsive within an extended volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and approximating 
\begin_inset Formula $h\approx-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c\approx-z^{-1}$
\end_inset

 within the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

, by way of the convolution relation and using a short hand notation 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\rho\kappa/\beta$
\end_inset

 for the compressibility factor, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\mu\approx\rho V_{0}(z^{-1}+1)/2$
\end_inset

.
 Water is nearly incompressible --- the corresponding compressibility factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx1/16$
\end_inset

 at normal conditions; RISM theories predict comparable numbers depending
 on the closure and water model.

 On the other hand, the large error of the RISM expression for chemical
 potential cannot be ignored in practical calculations.
 In passing, we note that an immediate reason for the erroneous behavior
 is the reliance on the solvent susceptibility 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$

 for the particular water density at normal conditions even in the regions
 with vanishingly small densities.
 It may be instructive to note that by using the ideal gas equation of state,

, and corresponding compressibility factor

 the nature of the charge densities

 The solvent charge density, when it appears in an expression for solvent
 electrostatic potential

\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{v}}=\rho\sum_{\alpha}q_{\alpha}h_{\alpha}$

; it carries net zero charge (for neutral solutes) and is represented on
 a uniform Cartesian grid.
 The corresponding potential is obtained by solving Poisson equation with
 periodic boundary conditions using fast Fourier transform.
 For neutral solutes with typical dipole moments and large periodic cells
 this may be justified

 For brevity we express the energy as a functional of the solute charge

 The corresponding solution will be denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}$

 The distribution of the site charges of the solute force-field parameterization
 is a coarse approximation 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{n}_{\text{u}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 of the solute charge distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, RISM calculations of the excess chemical potential with the discrete
 force-field and delocalized gas-phase charge distributions as inputs will
 give two lowest approximations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu[\bar{n}_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

, for the excess chemical potential of the solute in solvent environment.
 The two approximations for the free energy 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\text{MM}}=E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]+\mu[\bar{n}_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\text{PT1}}=E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]+\mu[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

 will be referred to as MM and PT1 in this work.
 We explain the reference to the first order perturbation theory (PT1) by
 declaring the excess chemical potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu[n_{\text{u}}]$
\end_inset

 to be a perturbation of the energy functional 
\begin_inset Formula $E[n_{\text{u}}]$
\end_inset

\begin{equation}
G[n_{\text{u}}]=E[n_{\text{u}}]+\mu[n_{\text{u}}].\label{eq:free-energy-functional}

The PT1 free energy is obtained by evaluating the free energy functional

 Further, it will be more convenient to operate with the free energy values

\begin_inset Formula $-E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta G_{\text{MM}} & = & \mu[\bar{n}_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]\nonumber \\
\Delta G_{\text{PT1}} & = & \mu[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]\nonumber \\
\Delta G_{\text{SCF}} & = & \left(E[n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}]-E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]\right)+\mu[n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}]\label{eq:dG-models-1}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E_{\text{SCF}}=E[n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}]-E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

 in the last equation is the energy corresponding to the solute polarization
 by the solvent, a non-negative value for any 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{u}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

.
 By construction, the solvent reaction field, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mu/\delta n_{\text{u}}=\phi_{\text{u}}$
\end_inset

, is an electrostatic addition to the Kohn--Sham potential; the corresponding
 electric field leads to the redistribution of the electron charge density
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}-n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

Conversely, since 
\begin_inset Formula $G[n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}]\leq G[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu_{\text{SCF}}=\mu[n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}]-\mu[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

 is necessarily a non-positive value with a magnitude larger or equal to
 that of the polarization energy: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu_{\text{SCF}}\leq-\Delta E_{\text{SCF}}$
\end_inset

 A simplified quadratic model for the energy functionals 
\begin_inset Formula $E$

\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

\begin_inset Formula $-2\leq\Delta\mu_{\text{SCF}}/\Delta E_{\text{SCF}}\leq-1,$
\end_inset

 with the lower bound realized in the limiting case of a linear 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to a static reaction field, Appendix [FIXME].
 We will demonstrate that for organic solutes in water examined in this
 work that ratio is not very far from 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

.
 We will estimate the magnitude of the polarization term, 
\begin_inset Formula $E[n_{\text{u}}^{(1^{\prime})}]-E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]$
\end_inset

, by applying a static solvent reaction field, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mu[\bar{n}_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]/\delta n_{\text{u}}$
\end_inset

, determined from the force field model of the solute to the QM system,
 thus approximating 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{u}}^{(1^{\prime})}\approx n_{\text{u}}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

, and assuming a fixed ratio of the two relaxation terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\text{PT2}}=\Delta G_{\text{PT1}}-\left(E[n_{\text{u}}^{(1^{\prime})}]-E[n_{\text{u}}^{(0)}]\right).\label{eq:dG-models-2}

The so introduced PT2 expression thus includes a term of second order in
 the solvent reaction field, though in a very approximate fashion.

 Similarly to other studies

 As can be seen from Table

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, when there is no PMV correction applied, the correlation coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 between MM-RISM with experimental values is only 0.30, which means that
 calculation results are poorly linear correlated with experiments.
 The mean absolute deviation (MAD) between MM-RISM and experimental values

 After applying the PMV correction, the linear correlation between

 This indicates that the cavity formation of the solute is mainly responsible

Our second combination strategy is to replace the partial atomic charge
 representation of solute sites as frozen charge density distributed in
 the simulation cell.
 Here the charge density of solute is determined from the unperturbed gas-phase
 QM calculations, while the water solvent distribution functions around
 solutes are solved from 3D RISM equation, with the electrostatic interaction
 between solute and solvent calculated by placing the solvent site in the
 ESP field of solute charge density.
 From the correlation coefficient matrix of Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 one could notice that the uncorrected PT1-RISM and uncorrected MM-RISM
 are strongly linear correlated, with

\begin_inset Formula $\text{MAD}=0.95$

kcal/mol from Table

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Therefore, it is not surprising to find again the weak linear correlation
 relationship when comparing uncorrected PT1-RISM with experimental values,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.33$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MAD}=17.57$

 The difference between uncorrected solvation free energy with experimental
 value shows the significant linear correlation with PMV, of which the linear
 fitting gives results with

\end_inset

 and intercept equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $-$

 With PMV correction applied, the linear correlation breaks as in MM model,

 The performance of applying correction term is similar as in MM method,
 yet with higher residence error.
 Here we need to emphasize that the slope fitted from uncorrected PT1 result
 is 5.12
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol, slightly higher than 4.88
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol in MM method.
 And this difference is due to be expected, since the ESP derived from atomic
 charge based on force field database, is not necessarily the same with
 that from electron density.
 The evidence could be found from Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dipole-moment"

\end_inset

, in which the dipole moments of gas phase solutes, calculated with MM method
 and unperturbed gas-phase charge density, show a moderate linear correlation.
 The slope of linear fitting is 0.84, with 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.68$
\end_inset

.
 Despite the tiny difference between the electrostatic property of solutes
 obtained from MM and PT1 method, we could still reach the conclusion that
 by replacing the atomic partial charge on neutral solute sites as unperturbed
 gas-phase charge density, the solvation free energy calculated from PT1-RISM
 is at the same level of accuracy with MM method.
 The effect of solute cavity formation contributes the most part to the
 error of solvation free energy calculation for neutral solute, thus by
 introducing the correction term, the calculated solvation free energy with
 PT1 is comparable with experimental results.

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimating response to the solvent field: PT2-RISM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous two combinations, the electronic structures of solutes are
 not perturbed by the solvent medium, which means that the calculated solvation
 free energy only contains the contribution of embedding a gas-phase molecule
 into the solution environment.
 From here we introduce the perturbation of solvent medium to solute in
 the reaction field manner.
 As the start, the solvent field is generated by MM-RISM calculation and
 fixed during the calculation, then applied to the total Hamiltonian of
 solute by Eqs.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ham_sol"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:solv_perturb"

\end_inset

.
 In this way the solvation free energy contains the relaxation energy of
 solute electronic structure induced by a fixed solvent medium.
 By Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:correcoeff-matrix"

\end_inset

 and Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:mad-matrix"

\end_inset

, we find that the solvation free energy from the uncorrected PT2-RISM calculati
on is strongly linear correlated with the MM and PT1 treatment of solute,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.99$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MAD}=1.28$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MAD}=1.66$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol respectively.
 The better agreement between PT2 and MM is easy to understand, because
 the excess chemical potential which dominates the solvation free energy
 value, is the same in both methods.
 When comparing the uncorrected PT2 results with experiments, we could observe
 that the linear correlation between them is even weakened, with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.20$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MAD}=19.10$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol, which is more than 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol higher than the MM and PT1 results.
 The increase of deviation is caused by the electron relaxation effect introduce
d in PT2-RISM combination.
 Since from the previous discussion we already know that the solute cavity
 formation contributes the most for the error of solvation free energy,
 therefore it will be interesting to investigate the contribution of electron
 relaxation effect, after eliminating the major error source.
 As listed in Table
\begin_inset space ~

 increases to

 PT1 method.

In the last section, for evaluation purpose we do not consider the change
 of solvent medium when the solute electronic structure is relaxed.
 However in order to properly include the energy perturbation caused by
 solute electron relaxation, the response of solvent medium to the change
 of solute electronic structure must be taken into account in the self-consisten
t combination of QM with 3D RISM.
 With no correction term applied in SCF-RISM calculation, the solute cavity
 formation effect still dominates the error in solvation free energy results,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.36$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MAD}=16.06$

.
 Despite the strong linear correlation with other combination strategies,
 of which the correlation coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 equal to 0.94, 0.97 and 0.93 with MM, PT1 and PT2 method respectively, the
 deviations are noticeable, which are 2.20, 1.74 and 3.19
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol.
 This indicates that by properly consider the perturbation of solute electronic
 structure and solvent medium to each other simultaneously, the results
 are different with cases in which only one-way response is considered.
 After PMV correction is applied in SCF-RISM calculation, we also obtained
 results which are in good agreement with experimental values, with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.86$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{MAD}=1.55$
\end_inset

 kcal/mol.
 Yet the mean absolute deviations with other three methods are decreased
 slightly even the major errors are removed, which are 1.86, 1.44 and 3.07
 kcal/mol for MM, PT1 and PT2 method respectively.

d, we could notice the significant error noise in the linear fitting of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{2}G$
\end_inset

 with PMV, which has the fitted slope equal to 5.13
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol, 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.92$
\end_inset

 and intercept equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $-$

3.97
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol.
 Unlike the absence of solute electron relaxation in MM and PT1 method,
 in which the solute electronic structure does not change, and the coincident
 offset when the solute is perturbed by a fixed solvent field, the significant
 deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{2}G$
\end_inset

 in SCF-RISM exists even in the "ideal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fitting line.
 By eliminating the dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{2}G$
\end_inset

 with PMV, we can see that the source of this deviation is due to the solute
 electron relaxation.
 The intercept of the linear fitting line for corrected results is still
 
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

3.97
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kcal/mol, with the slope equal to 0.92 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}=0.27$
\end_inset

 .
 From the results of SCF-RISM results, we find that for neutral solutes,
 the correction which is responsible for the solute cavity formation is
 not enough to determine the accuracy of solvation free energy calculation.
 The error noise caused by the solute electron relaxation, which shares
 the same magnitude as the experimental value of the solvation free energy
 of neutral solute in aqueous medium, should be examined carefully in relevant
 studies.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation of self-cosistent QM combination with RISM model reveals
 that for neutral solutes, the accuracy of the calculated solvation free
 energy is mainly determined by the solute cavity formation.
 The better agreement with experimental results could be obtained by applying
 partial molar volume correction as reported also in previous non-SCF studies.
 Another important factor, the change of the solute electrostatic property,
 which is perturbed by the solvent medium, is also found to have noticeable
 contribution to the solvation free energy calculation.
 Meanwhile, from the RDF in SCF-RISM, we found that the rearrangement of
 the solute charge density calculation causes the strengthening of the hydrogen
 bond between solute and water solvent.
