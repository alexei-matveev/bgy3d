Molecule strucutre from NIST database
=====================================

All the structures are downloaded from
http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ and renamed with the names listed in
the (*.sdf, *.mol) files. Format converting from CRLF to LF was
performed before recording in our repository.

Current available molecules:
----------------------------

Alcohols      Aldehydes       Carboxylic acids
----------    ------------    -----------------
methanol      formaldehyde    formic acid
ethanol       acetaldehyde    acetic acid
1-propanol    propanal        propanoic acid^a^
1-butanol     butanal         butanoic acid
1-pentanol    pentanal        pentanoic acid
-----------------------------------------------

a) only 2d strucuture file is available for propanoic acid
   (propanoic_acid.mol), in which hydrogen atoms are missing
