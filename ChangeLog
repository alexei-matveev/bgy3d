	* bgy3d-solutes.c: Lennard-Jones, Coulomb-short,  and by way of it
	also Coulomb total  are regularized starting at 20%  of the length
	scale:  combined  sigma  for  LJ  and Ewald  scale  parameter  for
	Coulomb. See comments on RMIN. The summary is lj0(1/5) = 976500000
	is still huge  and Coulomb at this distance is 5  * 332 kcal which
	is huge too. The real reason is that this setting was already used
	for  quite some calculations  and I  want it  to be  recorded. The
	effect of the observables is minimal.

	* rism-rdf.c (rism_rdf): Use trilinear interpolation for RDF. This
	is much faster: O(1) per point  instead of O(n^3). RDFs are not in
	the  testsuite  so  this  change  will go  unnoticed.   A  notable
	observable  change however  is the  absense of  "ringing"  next to
	sharp  edges  typical for  trigonometric  interpolation.  Also  it
	looks like  the peaks  and other features  of RDF  got "smoother".
	There is no flag yet to turn the old behaviour on, you may need to
	flip the variable in this file.

	* hnc3d.c (solvent_kernel): Inquire --no-renorm flag. This changes
	the default behaviour of 3D RISM calculations. The solvent kernel
	derived from 1D RISM will now also return the effect of applying
	the solvent susceptibility to a potential of a gaussian
	charge. This will be later used to renormalize the indirect
	correlation for many-atomic solutes. The old behaviour is restored
	by supplying --no-renorm flag. The default operation mode is not
	represented in testsuite so the reference outputs did not
	change.

	* README (database): The effect of --no-renorm flag for water is
	about 0.05 kcal. For charged solutes you will get garbage with
	this flag.

	* guile/bgy3d.scm (option-spec): accept --no-renorm in command
	line.

	* hnc3d.c (solvent_kernel): inquire --solvent-3d.  This changes
	the defaults for 3D RISM.  Without specifying --solvent-3d the 3D
	solute/solvent code will atomatically invoke 1D RISM to prepare
	the solvent kernel. Historically one had to specify --solvent-1d
	to achieve that.

	* guile/bgy3d.scm (option-spec): --solvent-1d is gone,
	--solvent-3d added.

	* test/Makefile (HNC-FLAGS): The testsuite still does a full 3D
	RISM pure solvent calculation followed by solute/solvent
	calculation that read the solvent susceptibility from the file.
	The flag --solvent-3d was added to match the reference output.

	* hnc3d.c (hnc3d_solute_solve): set neutral_solutes = false to
	compute the real-space representation of the long-range potential
	directly as opposed to the inverse FFT of its k-rep. The latter
	procedure cannot be expected to give meaningful results for
	charged solutes. This real-space representation is primarily used
	to integrate the chemical potential. The reference results do
	change and had to be updated. The chemical potential of the water
	changed by about -0.02 kcal, for butanoic acid by about -0.04
	kcal.

	Another use of the real-space representation of the long-range
	potential is to compute the expectation value <ρ_v|U_u> which is
	the interaction of the solvent density and solute potential. For
	water the change of this observable was about -0.04 kcal, for
	butanoic acid about -0.09 kcal. Also, since the complimentary
	observable <U_v|ρ_u> still uses the FFT to compute the field of
	the solvent volume charge, the agreement of the two is no more
	exact.

	* bgy3d-solutes.c (bgy3d_solute_field): set analytic_form = true
	to compute the k-space representation of the long-range potential
	directly as opposed to the way via the FFT transform of the
	tabulated smeared core density. This change slightly affects the
	numbers of the testsuite. The reference outputs have been
	updated. Also the branch that adds the contribution of the
	electronic density is incomplete and will abort when used.

	* rism.f90 (rism_uv): Switched to optimized Ng scheme for
	solute/solvent code by exploiting the linearity of T[c]. The
	transformation is formally exact so that the numbers hardly
	change. There was no need to adapt the testsuite.
