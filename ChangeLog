	* bgy3d-solutes.c (bgy3d_solute_field): set analytic_form = true
	to compute the k-space representation of the long-range potential
	directly as opposed to the way via the FFT transform of the
	tabulated smeared core density. This change slightly affects the
	numbers of the testsuite. The reference outputs have been
	updated. Also the branch that adds the contribution of the
	electronic density is incomplete and will abort when used.

	* rism.f90 (rism_uv): Switched to optimized Ng scheme for
	solute/solvent code by exploiting the linearity of T[c]. The
	transformation is formally exact so that the numbers hardly
	change. There was no need to adapt the testsuite.
