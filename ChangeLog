	* hnc3d.c (solvent_kernel): inquire --solvent-3d.  This changes
	the defaults for 3D RISM.  Without specifying --solvent-3d the 3D
	solute/solvent code will atomatically invoke 1D RISM to prepare
	the solvent kernel. Historically one had to specify --solvent-1d
	to achieve that.

	* guile/bgy3d.scm (option-spec): --solvent-1d is gone,
	--solvent-3d added.

	* test/Makefile (HNC-FLAGS): The testsuite still does a full 3D
	RISM pure solvent calculation followed by solute/solvent
	calculation that read the solvent susceptibility from the file.
	The flag --solvent-3d was added to match the reference output.

	* hnc3d.c (hnc3d_solute_solve): set neutral_solutes = false to
	compute the real-space representation of the long-range potential
	directly as opposed to the inverse FFT of its k-rep. The latter
	procedure cannot be expected to give meaningful results for
	charged solutes. This real-space representation is primarily used
	to integrate the chemical potential. The reference results do
	change and had to be updated. The chemical potential of the water
	changed by about -0.02 kcal, for butanoic acid by about -0.04
	kcal.

	Another use of the real-space representation of the long-range
	potential is to compute the expectation value <ρ_v|U_u> which is
	the interaction of the solvent density and solute potential. For
	water the change of this observable was about -0.04 kcal, for
	butanoic acid about -0.09 kcal. Also, since the complimentary
	observable <U_v|ρ_u> still uses the FFT to compute the field of
	the solvent volume charge, the agreement of the two is no more
	exact.

	* bgy3d-solutes.c (bgy3d_solute_field): set analytic_form = true
	to compute the k-space representation of the long-range potential
	directly as opposed to the way via the FFT transform of the
	tabulated smeared core density. This change slightly affects the
	numbers of the testsuite. The reference outputs have been
	updated. Also the branch that adds the contribution of the
	electronic density is incomplete and will abort when used.

	* rism.f90 (rism_uv): Switched to optimized Ng scheme for
	solute/solvent code by exploiting the linearity of T[c]. The
	transformation is formally exact so that the numbers hardly
	change. There was no need to adapt the testsuite.
